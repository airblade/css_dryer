Below is a complete list of changes for each revision of CssDryer.

== HEAD

* Updated test nested stylesheet to render a partial and call a helper.

== 0.4.0

* Refactored file layout so tests run again.

== 0.3.1

* Merged Mina Guib's refactoring of the template handling code.  Partials now work again.  Thanks Mina!

== 0.3.0

* Rails 2.2 compatibility (thanks to Josh Peek for help).
* The self_clear helper accepts a :clear option.

== 0.2.8

* Fixed bug in Stylesheets Helper affecting ie6 method (thanks to René).
* Removed code in +render+ method made redundant by Rails 2.1.

== 0.2.7

* Rails 2.1 compatibility (thanks to Pete Yandell).

== 0.2.6

* Added a few browser hacks to StylesheetsHelper (thanks to René for the idea).
* Add self-clearing to StylesheetsHelper.

== 0.2.5

* Added a generator for convenience.

== 0.2.4

* Fixed README to use proper Markdown syntax for links.

== 0.2.3

* Fixed typo in NcssHandler#render (reported by Ryan Kuykendall).

== 0.2.2

* Removed compilation step because it doesn't allow post-processing.

== 0.2.1

* Fixed typo with name of NcssHandler's compile method.
* Elaborated README's partials example.

== 0.2.0

* Supports partial templates.
* Works with Rails's template compilation mechanism.
* Requires Rails 2.

== 0.1.5

* Achieved compatibility with Markaby by adding filepath paramater to template rendering (NcssHandler#render) method signature (incompatibility reported by Ray Carrasco).

== 0.1.4

* Commas in comments are sometimes replaced with a space to prevent them from being interpreted as selectors (thanks to Adrian Prodan for the bug report).  Yes, this is a shameful hack.
* Added tests for multiline comments and comments containing blank lines (suggested by Phil Crosby).
* Added a section on how comments are handled to the README.
* Removed page_cache_extension line from the StylesheetsController code.  It was unnecessary and forced all cached pages, including HTML ones, to have a .css extension.

== 0.1.3

* Instance and local variables from the controller now available within stylesheets (thanks to Rifraf for prodding me into action).

== 0.1.2

* Incompatible with Rails 1.1.6 and below thanks to the use of <code>:format</code> in a route.  Update to Rails 1.2RC1 :)
* Caches correctly with <code>.css</code> extension.  Updated the README with the necessary changes to the controller and routes.
* Works with the <code>stylesheet_link_tag</code> helper.  Updated the README with the changes to make this work.

== 0.1.1

* Handles comma separated selectors (suggested by John Nunemaker).
* No longer outputs nested blank lines (noticed by Adi).

== 0.0.5

* Changed extension from <code>.dcss</code> to <code>.ncss</code> to avoid clashing with Miles Byrne's DCSS stylesheets (suggested by Miles).

== 0.0.4

* Handles class, pseudo-class, attribute, id, child and adjacent selectors (suggested by Adi and Maxim Kulkin).

* Handles descendant selectors.
* Handles ERB.
