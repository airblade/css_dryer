= Change Log

Below is a complete list of changes for each revision of CssDryer.

== 0.1.4

* Commas in comments are sometimes replaced with a space to prevent them from being interpreted as selectors (thanks to Adrian Prodan for the bug report).  Yes, this is a shameful hack.
* Added tests for multiline comments and comments containing blank lines (suggested by Phil Crosby).
* Added a section on how comments are handled to the README.
* Removed page_cache_extension line from the StylesheetsController code.  It was unnecessary and forced all cached pages, including HTML ones, to have a .css extension.

== 0.1.3

* Instance and local variables from the controller now available within stylesheets (thanks to Rifraf for prodding me into action).

== 0.1.2

* Incompatible with Rails 1.1.6 and below thanks to the use of <code>:format</code> in a route.  Update to Rails 1.2RC1 :)
* Caches correctly with <code>.css</code> extension.  Updated the README with the necessary changes to the controller and routes.
* Works with the <code>stylesheet_link_tag</code> helper.  Updated the README with the changes to make this work.

== 0.1.1

* Fixed bug where comma separated style values, e.g. font families, were misinterpreted as comma separated selectors.

== 0.1.0

* Handles comma separated selectors (suggested by John Nunemaker).
* No longer outputs nested blank lines (noticed by Adi).

== 0.0.5

* Changed extension from <code>.dcss</code> to <code>.ncss</code> to avoid clashing with Miles Byrne's DCSS stylesheets (suggested by Miles).
* Clarified the lack of support for nested, multiple, comma separated selectors by adding a paragraph to the README's Which Selectors Are Supported section.

== 0.0.4

* Handles class, pseudo-class, attribute, id, child and adjacent selectors (suggested by Adi and Maxim Kulkin).
* No longer outputs empty selectors (noticed by Adi).
* Fixed typo in nesting example in README.

== 0.0.3

* Fixed bug where parameter was passed to the wrong method.

== 0.0.2

* Added support for <code>@media</code> blocks.
* Fixed bug in handling of non-nested descendant selectors.

* Handles descendant selectors.
